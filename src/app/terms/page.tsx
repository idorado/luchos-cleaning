      </p>

      <h2>2. Quotes, Pricing & Payment</h2>

        <li><strong>Payment timing:</strong> Payment is due at service completion unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>3. Scheduling, Rescheduling & Cancellations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notice:</strong> Please provide at least 24–48 hours' notice to reschedule or cancel (the exact window is shown on your quote or confirmation).</li>
        <li><strong>Late cancellation / lockout:</strong> If we arrive and cannot access the property, or you cancel within the notice window, a fee may apply to cover the reserved slot and staff time.</li>
        <li><strong>Delays:</strong> We aim to arrive within the scheduled window; traffic, weather, and prior jobs can affect timing. We'll communicate promptly about material delays.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Access & Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You are responsible for providing safe access (keys, codes, gate). Please secure pets and valuables.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Pick up personal items or heavy clutter so we can focus on cleaning tasks. For refrigerators/ovens or other add-ons, ensure they're empty/unplugged if required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Exclusions & Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hazardous conditions (mold beyond surface level, biohazards, infestations, human/animal waste) are out of scope.</li>
        <li>Heights/areas requiring unsafe ladders or roof access are excluded.</li>
        <li>Heavy lifting, moving large furniture or appliances is not included unless explicitly agreed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Supplies & Equipment</h2>
      <p>

        products or provide your own, you accept responsibility for results on those surfaces.

      </ul>

      <h2>8. Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        If something wasn't cleaned as expected, contact us within 24–48 hours. We will arrange a re-clean
        of the missed areas as soon as reasonably possible. The guarantee does not apply after new use/soil
        or outside the reporting window.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Photos & Testimonials</h2>
      <p>
        With your permission, we may take before/after photos of work areas to document results, quality,
        and training. We do not photograph personal identifying items. Testimonials or images are only used
        for marketing with your consent.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Health, Safety & Pets</h2>
      <p>
        For everyone's safety, our team will not handle hazardous materials or aggressive animals. Please
        secure pets during service. We may pause or decline tasks that pose safety risks.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Recurring Services</h2>
      <p>
        If you select a recurring plan (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), the effective rate assumes continued
        cadence. Skips or significant intervals may require a deeper service and adjusted pricing.
