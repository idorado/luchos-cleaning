            Kathy Clean started over ten years ago in Castle Rock, Colorado, founded by Kathy; whose name still represents everything we stand for. We never had the chance to meet her, but those who did speak highly of her values: a commitment to service and the belief that a cleaning company is only as good as the people doing the work. We still live by that principle today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, Jessica and Carl took over and expanded the company into the commercial space. Under their leadership, Kathy Clean began servicing some of the most well-known brands in the U.S., including Starbucks, Whole Foods, IKEA, PetSmart, and many others you probably know. The company moved to Centennial to better serve the Denver area, while staying true to its roots: find the best people and always stand behind the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that time, they also acquired C-thru Window Washing, a respected local company known for delivering the best window cleaning service in the area. The same trusted team that has served customers for over a decade continues to provide that same impeccable service; now under the Kathy Clean name.

          Recently, we entered a new chapter. Jessica and Carl decided to move on, and a new team took the baton. More committed than ever to delivering high-quality service and being the easiest company to work with. We stay true to our principles. If something’s not right, we fix it. Not next time, but now. We believe in close communication and clear expectations. Technology should make things easier, not replace the human connection.

          That’s why we exist. Not just to clean, but to create environments where people thrive.
